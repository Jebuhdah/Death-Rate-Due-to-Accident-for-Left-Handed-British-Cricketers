# Death-Rate-Due-to-Accident-for-Left-Handed-British-Cricketers
In countries such as the UK where firearm is legal with a certificate, as firearms are made for 
righthanded users as the majority and clears bullet shells on the right side, which position where 
lefthanded user positions their face at, which poses danger to lefthanded users when using firearm in 
sports such as hunting and has a high chance of causing accidents. And although may not be as extreme,
cases like this exists in many other sports that may leads to a higher accident rate for lefthanded 
individuals and a rise in their death rate due to their handedness.

Therefore, here we wish to raise the hypothesis that left-handed people are more susceptible to 
accidental death than right-handed people, and we will examine it through the data of a sport that is 
more mild - cricketing, with the data provided by DAAG Cricket data, which includes the year, birth, and 
lifespan, etc. of British first-class cricketers born in the time span of 1840-1960, and their leading causes 
of deaths of in bed due to sickness or other reasons, and the deaths by accidents which we wish to 
examine, with killed in action as a subset of those who died by accident as the time span covers events 
such as both world wars which we would wish to remove as we do not consider it as accident here, 
together with the information of their handedness included, as of 1992 with 5960 observations.
